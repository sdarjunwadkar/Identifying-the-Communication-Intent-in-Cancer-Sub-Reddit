The CT showed that on top of the seemingly enlarged lymph node near my shoulder, I had clusters of them near my lungs (which the doctor reassured me wasn't affecting my lungs whatsoever). I met an oncologist that afternoon and was set up for a biopsy which turns out to be tomorrow at 1:30pm. \n",

Yesterday, even while not being religious, I was physically praying to god that the results turn out positive. Today, I'm pissed off at the whole situation. Tomorrow, I will most likely be scared but who knows; I've covered the whole spectrum in the span of under a week.\n",

            "(4) --> I feel guilty. May 15th, 2021, I (F20) went to the ER with what I suspected was an appendicitis. As a nursing student I knew the signs and symptoms of one, but I thought I would only have antibiotics or something, and not surgery. However, after a CT and ultrasound, they saw my appendix was inflamed and nothing else. 10 hours after getting to the hospital, I finally got into surgery. We intended for the procedure to be laparoscopic but it ended up having to be an open procedure. Why? Because when my surgeon went into my abdomen, he found a tumour on my small bowel and although we hadn’t talked about it, he knew it should be taken out and biopsied. After a week stay in the hospital and another week recovering at home, I got the biopsy results and it came back as neuroendocrine tumours/cancer. Yes pleural. They also found two on my appendix. \n",
            "\n",
            "However, I feel guilty because I’m now considered a cancer patient, but everything (tests/scans etc) is coming back clear and all I need is the okay from an oncologist and specialist after further testing and scans to be cleared as “cancer free” and “in remission.” But I feel like I never fought. So many other people have to fight to their breaking point to beat these diseases, but here I am, had no symptoms or side effects of the tumours, got them removed, and I’m potentially “in remission” already. \n",

My fiancée is now considering all option to try to reduce the tumor (radiation, alternative medicines, etc.) and make her as comfortable as possible. We don’t know if she’ll even make it to the wedding in September, and I’m starting to investigate a civil service that we can have very soon with immediate family so she can still present.\n",

He stopped working decades ago because of his illness, making my mother in law the sole bread winner to look after the entire family.

I personally feel his waves of negative attitude and outbursts have had a direct impact on her health. My fiancee has even voiced this to her mother but her mother feels responsible for him and doesn’t think anyone else would look after him.

I'm 22 years old and living in west Seattle, WA, where I'm also incredibly low-income and working as a freelance artist (so basically yeah, no-money-ville). For the past 2 years at least, I've known of an almond-sized lump in the left side of my left breast (near the underarm). For one reason or another I dismissed it all that time, since it seemed inert and wasn't causing me any discomfort. In recent months, however, it seems to have gotten larger and extended more towards the center of my breast, having more the shape and size of a small grape with roots attached. It's also uncomfortable to the touch now, and I can't apply any pressure on it without it hurting. I can feel it when I move, whereas I didn't before. \n",

            "(1) --> My friend is losing her mother and I don't know how to help. (Advice if you have any!) So a very close friend of mine's mother was in a car accident and during some testing they found a brain tumor. They operated, but they still are saying it doesn't look good. I honestly don't remember the type of cancer that it is but I do know that the survival rate is low.\n",

            "My friend and I do not live in the same state so we spend a good portion of the day texting each other. She is struggling not only with the fact that she is losing her mother (they are very close) but also that her family is not helping her with the day to day problems at all. Driving her mother to her chemo sessions, taking care of finances, even simple stuff like cleaning or whatever. Her husband is also being less than helpful and is often arguing with her about how she isn't being very thoughtful to him. \n",
            "\n",
            "Really her life is just falling down around her and I'm doing everything I can to be there for her and be helpful, but I feel like my help is so stupid. I listen and I try to give constructive help, but like 90% of the time I feel like I'm grasping at straws to try and come up with something to say. I don't know what to do when she says she wants to escape it all or that her life is a joke. I'm just at a loss. \n",
            "\n",
            "I've never had to deal with this type of struggle before and I was wondering if any of you had any advice for me on how best to be there for her. What I can say or do (even from a distance) that might make her feel better or at least help take some of the stress off. \n",

Technically NED after three months of BEP chemo for mediastinal seminoma. Finished chemo a little over a month ago. Asked my mom to rub some essential oil on my back because I was feeling sore/get tense in the mornings. Mornings seem to be when I feel the strangest still. Anyway, when she finishes, she essentially says feeling good one week but feeling bad the next is no way to live life. Like, what? No shit. Think I just plan to feel crappy some days? Of course not. I’m only a month out of chemo. They practically poisoned me for a few months, and who the hell knows what kind of damage/scar tissue/physical effects the cancer + chemo will have short term or long term. \n",
            "\n",
            "Everyone’s being really supportive, but it feels like now that I have “good days” more often than bad, I’m expected to just feel good all the time. “Well, you haven’t even changed your eating habits,” my mom says. “That’s part of it.” She’s also starting to worry about my port and dealing with having it flushed for the next couple of years. “I talked to someone at church who knew someone who didn’t have theirs cleaned well and they got a staph infection and died. Maybe you should think about taking yours out soon instead of leaving it in for two years.” \n",

            "Just a little frustrating this morning. Sure, I want to get back to normal life and get the hell out of this little room in my parents’ house (moved in when treatment started), but I just don’t feel like I’ve got the energy or even a fucking plan of attack for my future. I don’t even think I’ve really processed getting cancer let alone being done with chemo and living as a cancer survivor for the rest of my life. I feel like I’m just twiddling my thumbs here while I recover/regroup. I really appreciate the support and being able to live here and have family close, but some days I feel like I’d be better off by myself where I don’t have other people’s expectations of how I should feel/heal invading. That said, I seriously feel like I’m doing absolutely nothing right now. I have no job. I sit in a 20’x20’ bedroom most of my day. I can’t even go for walks outside because it’s freezing out. I exercise just a little/walk on the treadmill a bit, but it’s nowhere near regular physical activity. I’m only just now sleeping through most of the night. I don’t feel sick like I did, but I still have days/moments where I’m just not...well. I’m intimidated by the idea of searching for/finding a new job and a place to live. Medical bills are a joke, so those are another issue entirely. I just don’t know what to do or how to do it, so I basically let each day pass by and then another one starts. I’m in limbo...\n",

Sometimes I feel as if it'll be okay and try to think of the days ahead of time, other days I can't seem to think past next week. My mental is broken. I just need a friend who has also been through this stuff to talk to. Is there anyone out there?\n",

            "(7) --> My godfather died. My godfather had cancer in his bile duct. The prognosis for those types of cancers is poor. He was very private about it, even reluctant to tell me, but I ended up finding out because he filled his scripts at the pharmacy I worked at. I didn’t press him about it, but prayed for the best. During that time my dad and I made food almost every week to take to their house. My godfather loved my dad’s cooking. Sometimes I would sit and eat in hopes that he would come out so I could see him. \n",

            "He went into remission at the end of 2019. We got to spend more time together. He was healthy and started playing golf again. Then COVID happened and I saw him less. The last time I saw him healthy was Father’s Day. He loves Nike so I brought him a gift card. I can still remember his smile. And then he was sick again. \n",
            "\n",
            "Since June of 2020 and last night when I kissed him goodbye, I’d only seen him once. I’d seen the way the cancer drew in his face. How small he really was. It scared the hell out of me. So when I saw him last night, it took everything not to burst into tears. My godfather was a shell of himself. The cancer had eaten away at his body, his personality, his liveliness. He could hear me but could barely open his eyes to greet me. I kissed him and told him how much I loved him, and that if he was tired it was okay to stop fighting. He passed away two hours ago. \n",
            "\n",
            "I just don’t understand why? My godfather was sweet, and kind. He loved my godmother, loved God, loved his family. He would call and check on me while I was at school. And the shit part is that I’m going to school to one day make drug therapies for cancer. And then he dies of cancer right before I get into pharmacy school? He just dies and there was nothing I could do about it... \n",

Then one day, out of the blue, weeds begin to sprout... Cancer! You rush (hopefully) to the garden doctor for help. They try to cut the weeds out, Surgery. Then they try nasty chemicals, Chemotherapy. And then they try to burn the weeds, Radiation treatment. The garden doctors are now gone. So, alone, after Treatment you are left with your now painful and beat up garden worrying, hopping the weeds won’t come back.\n",
            "The problem I see here is that the soil of your garden is the same soil that the weeds grew in, in the first place. That same soil, your life system, has a high chance of growing new and stronger weeds in the near future. What to do? Change your soil. Your soil is your mental state, your diet, your physical fitness, your quality of sleep and the levels of stress you live with.\n",
